# Goodbye, Boredom. - An activity suggestion app

## Description
Goodbye, Boredom. came about to fill a need for users feeling trapped in a state of boredome. Often it is hard to come up with things to do when you are so extremely bored, so I developed an app to draw the user in and output random activities they can partake in to rid themselves of boredom.
